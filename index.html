    <h1> CATS VERY CUTE</h1>
    <h2>cats are very nice, but if you step on their tail... THEN YOU WILL NOT LIVE</h2>
    <p>cats do not like loneliness, but if you still leave cats alone at home, your house will not live. There will be garbage, dirt, and so on everywhere in your house. But cats are still beautiful</p1>
